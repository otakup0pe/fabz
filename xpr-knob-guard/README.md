# XPR series "Knob Guard"

The OpenSCAD file was created with some assistance from a cursed computer hallucination during the pre-season of Burning Man 2025. The resulting device may be used for protect the volume and channel knobs on a XPR 7550/3500e [MOTOTRBO](https://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/MOTOTRBO) series radio. Many users report the volume knobs changing unexpectedly when entering/exiting vehicles, doing complicated physical tasks while wearing radio harnesses, or dropping your radio in a cooler.

There are two included STL files for the two variants of antenna I stumbled across. There may be more variants, calipers are your friend! Please feel free to submit a pull request with additional parameter presets! The OpenSCAD file has detailed configuration options...

* Layout parameters which may support different XPR radios.
* Configurable converage and (radial) placement of the volume and channel knob guards.
* An optional "notch" to make it easier to detach/attach a shoulder mic.
